DONE:

- finalise the parser for other device - DONE (yet to be tested with more chats)
- ability to add more whatsapp chats for analysis, keeping previous. - DONE
- search bar for text - DONE
- frequency analysis of the most used words - partially DONE


Yet to be done:
- Add a chat box/bot to the page  *AI*
- With the chatbot you can ask questions about your conversation  *AI*
  e.g.
  "What was the topic of the conversation during last week"
  "Does my mum hate me" <- if response possible
- Mood analysis *AI*
- Convert each text message to emoji only *AI*
- Translate each of the chats *AI*

- Add the stop_words_spanish to the counter, so it doesnt count those words. Actual form doesnt work.
- Change the time range in the message density over time graph (not a requirement nor a priority)


Vectorization, split it into dates. (chop it?) langchange
