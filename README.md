# Data Analyzer for WhatsApp Chats

## Overview
Text analysis, also known as text mining, is the process of compiling, analyzing, and 
extracting valuable insights or information from large volumes of unstructured texts, using 
machine learning and NLP (natural language processing) techniques.
The sheer volume of data available on the internet today is incomprehensible. And 
manually analyzing this data is not really an efficient option.
